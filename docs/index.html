        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Food recipes, just like software code, require testing. In the
            culinary world, recipe testers play an essential role in the
            creation of a cookbook by making sure that what the chef/author
            describes can be implemented by other people and that the recipes
            work as described.
        </p>
        <p>
            The similarities between food and code also work the other way. We
            call code that is difficult to read spaghetti code. We are
            encouraged to eat our own code, which means using it ourselves as a
            way to test it. Code that doesn't work is half-baked. A sample code
            fragment is called a recipe and collections of coding recipes are
            known as cookbooks, like The JavaScript Cookbook by Shelly Powers
            and The C# Cookbook by Jay Hilyard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open source software has a particular indebtedness to the food
            world. As with food recipes, having lots of people review your code
            only makes it stronger and more reliable. This is the premise of
            Linus's Law, which promotes the idea that a key benefit of open
            source over closed source software is that it gets more eyes and is
            more likely to get seen by those who can find and resolve bugs in
            the codebase.
        </p>

                In the tradition of open source, the authors of the chapters in
                this cookbook are giving back to the community by sharing
                favorite recipes - free, online, and downloadable. Enjoy
                appetizers, entrees, and desserts from around the world,
                courtesy of our global developer community!
